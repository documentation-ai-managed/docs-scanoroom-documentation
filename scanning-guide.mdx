## LiDAR Technology Basics

ScanoRoom leverages your iPhone's LiDAR sensor to capture precise depth measurements. Understanding how this technology works helps you optimize your scanning approach.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="How LiDAR Works" icon="radar">
    LiDAR emits infrared light pulses and measures their return time to calculate distances.
    
    <Expandable title="Sensor Specifications" default-open="false">
      - Range: Up to 5 meters
      - Accuracy: ±1mm at 1 meter
      - Field of view: 60° horizontal × 55° vertical
    </Expandable>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Data Processing" icon="database">
    Raw sensor data is processed into point clouds representing spatial coordinates.
    
    <Expandable title="Point Cloud Density" default-open="false">
      Higher density provides more detail but requires more processing power.
    </Expandable>

## Scanning Techniques

Different scanning scenarios require specific techniques. Choose the appropriate method based on your space and objectives.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Preparation" icon="clipboard-check">
    Clear the space of obstacles and ensure adequate lighting. Remove reflective objects that may interfere with sensors.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Positioning" icon="crosshair">
    Hold your iPhone at chest height, keeping the screen facing the area you want to scan.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Movement" icon="arrow-right">
    Move steadily at walking pace, maintaining overlap between scanning passes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Coverage" icon="target">
    Ensure complete coverage by scanning from multiple angles and heights.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verification" icon="eye">
    Review the live preview for gaps or low-quality areas and rescan as needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Room Scanning" default-open="true">
    For interior spaces, start in one corner and work methodically around the room, ensuring 30% overlap between passes.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Large Areas" default-open="false">
    Break large spaces into sections, scanning each area completely before moving to the next.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Complex Objects" default-open="false">
    For furniture or detailed objects, scan from multiple close-range positions.
  </Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

## Quality Control and Troubleshooting

Monitor scan quality in real-time and address issues immediately to avoid costly reshoots.

<Callout kind="alert">
  If scan quality drops below 80%, pause and adjust your technique or environmental conditions.
</Callout>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Common Issues" icon="alert-triangle">
    <Expandable title="Low Quality Areas" default-open="true">
      Caused by fast movement, poor lighting, or reflective surfaces. Solution: Slow down and improve lighting.
    </Expandable>
    
    <Expandable title="Gaps in Coverage" default-open="false">
      Occurs when moving too quickly or not overlapping passes sufficiently. Solution: Use slower, more overlapping movements.
    </Expandable>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Optimization Tips" icon="zap">
    <Expandable title="Lighting Conditions" default-open="true">
      Use diffuse, even lighting. Avoid direct sunlight or deep shadows that can confuse sensors.
    </Expandable>
    
    <Expandable title="Surface Types" default-open="false">
      Matte surfaces scan better than glossy or transparent materials. Cover mirrors and glass if possible.
    </Expandable>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Advanced Scanning Scenarios

Handle complex scanning situations with specialized techniques and equipment considerations.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Multi-Room Projects" icon="building">
    Create separate scans for each room and use alignment features to combine them into a unified model.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Outdoor Scanning" icon="sun">
    Schedule scans during overcast conditions and use tripods for stability in windy conditions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Night Scanning" icon="moon">
    Use artificial lighting to maintain consistent illumination and avoid sensor overload.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<CodeGroup tabs="Configuration,Advanced Settings">
````javascript
// Configure scan parameters
ScanoRoom.scan({
  quality: "high",
  range: "auto",
  stabilization: true,
  realTimePreview: true
});
````
````javascript
// Advanced processing options
ScanoRoom.process({
  noiseReduction: true,
  holeFilling: "automatic",
  meshOptimization: "balanced",
  textureMapping: true
});
````
</CodeGroup>

## Post-Processing and Refinement

After scanning, use ScanoRoom's tools to clean up and enhance your 3D models.

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Noise Reduction" default-open="true">
    Remove unwanted points and smooth rough areas using automatic or manual tools.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Hole Filling" default-open="false">
    Automatically fill gaps in the mesh where data was insufficient.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Mesh Optimization" default-open="false">
    Reduce polygon count while maintaining detail for better performance.
  </Expandable>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Always save original scan data before applying destructive post-processing operations.
